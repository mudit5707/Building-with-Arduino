# Building-with-Arduino
A collection of multiple beginner codes written in Arduino IDE
📌 Description

Building with Arduino is a collection of beginner-level Arduino programs written using the Arduino IDE.
This repository focuses on understanding fundamental microcontroller concepts through simple, hands-on implementations and simulation-based circuits.

The codes are designed to be:

Easy to read and modify

Concept-oriented rather than optimized

Suitable for beginners exploring Arduino, electronics, and embedded systems

📁 Contents of the Repository

This repository currently contains four Arduino programs:

1️⃣ PID Control (Basic Implementation)

A simple PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control algorithm

Built under specific problem constraints

Intended to demonstrate:

Control logic

Error correction

Basic feedback systems

This is not an optimized or industry-grade PID, but a conceptual introduction.

2️⃣ LED Bar Graph

Simulated using TinkerCAD

Demonstrates:

Digital output control

Sequential LED activation

Basic circuit-to-code interaction

Includes:

Arduino code

Circuit diagram (image)

3️⃣ Potentiometer-Controlled LED Brightness

Uses a potentiometer to control LED brightness

Demonstrates:

Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)

analogRead() and analogWrite()

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

Includes:

Arduino code

TinkerCAD circuit image

4️⃣ LED Push Button ON/OFF Switch

Controls an LED using a push button

Demonstrates:

Digital input handling

Arduino as a microcontroller and power source

Basic logic for ON/OFF state control

Includes:

Arduino code

TinkerCAD circuit image
