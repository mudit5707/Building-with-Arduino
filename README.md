# 🔧 Building with Arduino

## 📌 Description
**Building with Arduino** is a collection of beginner-level Arduino programs written using the **Arduino IDE**.  
This repository focuses on understanding **fundamental microcontroller concepts** through simple, hands-on implementations and simulation-based circuits.

The codes are:
- Beginner-friendly
- Easy to read and modify
- Concept-oriented rather than optimized
